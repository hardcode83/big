"""The closed vocabulary of `audit_logs.action` and `entity_type` (R6.5, design D4).

PRD §7.25 types both columns as free-form `VARCHAR`, which is exactly why they need a
vocabulary in code: `ix_audit_logs_tenant_id_entity_type_entity_id` only helps if every
writer spells the entity type the same way, and rule 9 of `steering/security.md` ("AuditLog
para … roles de User") is only auditable if a role change is findable by `action` rather
than by a JSONB query over `changes`.

One row per API mutation (design D4): a `PATCH` that changes the role **and** the profile
records `USER_ROLE_CHANGED` with both fields in `changes`, not two rows.

Not enums: §7.25 declares plain strings and `AuditLog.action` is typed `str`. Constants
give the single spelling without pretending the column is constrained.
